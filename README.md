# Welcome to GitHub Page for the Workshop in Applied Bioinformatics using R and Phyton 
## (St. John's University: BIO/BIT 209: Bioinformatics)

You can access the [BIO/BIT 209 bookdown](https://corytophanes.github.io/bioinformatics_class/intro.html) that includes our class manual and examples.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/corytophanes/test/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
